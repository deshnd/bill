 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Write a new function named "greet" which accepts two String parameters.

     The first parameter is named "from" and the second is named "to".

     The function returns nothing but produces as a side effect the printing of

     "Greetings from ", then the name specified in the parameter "from", then

     " to " and then the name specified in the parameter "to" and ends with a period.
