 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Write a new function named "hollers" which accepts two String parameters
     and an Integer parameter.
     The first parameter is named "from" and the second is named "to".
     The third parameter is named "repeated".
     The function returns nothing but produces as a side effect the printing of
     the name specified in "from", then " hollers ", then the name specified in "to"
     repeated "repeated" times, separated by commas and a space.
     After each "to" name, exclamation points are used consistent with the number
     of times the name is specified up to that point.
