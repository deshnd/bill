 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Define a function with the following signature:
         printDenominations(forSum:String)
     
     Given an arbitrary sum of money, print, in order from the largest denomination
     to the smallest, the number of units of each denomination required to
     produce the sum, each time using the largest denomination possible, and preferring
     paper bills to coins.
*    The first line should be the text "Original sum: " followed by the argument, properly
     formatted for U.S. currency.
*    The following output should be one denomination per line, skipping denominations with 
     zero units.  The first number must be the number of units, followed by a space, an 'x',
     another space then the name of the denomination as listed below, being sure to use
     the singular or plural as appropriate.
*    The final two lines should list the number of "Bills: " and the number of "Coins: ".     

*    Available denominations are limited to:
     $100 bill
     $50 bill
     $20 bill
     $10 bill
     $5 bill
     $2 bill

     $1 (one dollar coin)
     $0.50 (half-dollar coin)
     $0.25 (quarter)
     $0.10 (dime)
